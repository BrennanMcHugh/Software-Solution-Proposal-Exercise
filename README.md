Software Engineering (Software Solution Proposal)

This repository contains my completed university performance assessment for the class D188 Software Engineering.

Within this repository are two files.

The first is a requirements document outlining a fictional company's need for a new CRM software solution.

The second file is my submission for the project in the form of a software solution proposal, detailing benefits of the solution, how it will meet the client's requirements, design of the solution, testing of the solution, and development methodologies.
